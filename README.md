<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>
<b>Plugin is a work in progress.</b>
</p>
<p>
EightyEighty is a plugin created by 0764 that enables devs to interface with their Minecraft server via an HTTP(S) interface on Port 8080.
</p>
<p>
This plugin allows the developer to directly alter, modify, and change the world, players, and server. The developer, for example, may utilise the plugin's web interface to burn the player or even get the server's TPS and CPU consumption. EightyEighty includes a thorough and fully annotated Configuration file, which is generated after the first Plugin startup and saved in the data folder as Config.yml. Additionally, the messages.yml file contains all of the plugin's messages and locales.</p>
